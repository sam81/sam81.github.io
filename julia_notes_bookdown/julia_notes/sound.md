# Working with sound

Julia has fairly good support for working with sound. The [WAV.jl](https://github.com/dancasimiro/WAV.jl) package can be used to read and write WAV files. The [DSP.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDSP/DSP.jl) package provides functions for digital signal processing. My [SndLib.jl](https://github.com/sam81/SndLib.jl) package provides functions to synthesize and process various sounds commonly used in psychoacoustic experiments.
