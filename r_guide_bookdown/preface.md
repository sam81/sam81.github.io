I started writing this guide in 2006 while I was learning R. It was always a work in progress, with incomplete bits and parts, and it wasn't updated for several years. Much as changed since then both in the R ecosystem, and in the way I use R for data analysis. I'm now in the process of revising it to reflect these changes. Because this guide was initially written when I still had very little knowledge not only of R but of programming in general, it tends to explain things with a very simple, beginner-friendly approach. I hope to maintain this aspect of the guide as I revise it. This remains very much a work in progress and  comes with NO WARRANTY whatsoever of being correct in any of its parts.

For me, this is like a R desk reference. Once I figure out some new useful function, how to solve a particular problem in R, or how to generate a certain graphic, I write it down in this guide. Next time I have to solve the same problem I quickly know where to find the answer, rather than wading through internet forums, stack overflow, or other websites hunting down the answer.
